About the folder
================
This is the configuration file for nagios.
You can define some template here.

----
host
----
The .cfg file is the config file for nagios.The .txt file used for the hostname and ip address and environment.

The format for the .txt file is:
hostname (there must have space) ip-address (there must have space) environment
If the requestor didn't specify the environment just ignore it.

The ad* mii* ijcore* mii_win-bck* mii_win-primary* is special.No need to modify it.

The host.txt is just used for remove host from nagios.Just write the hostname inside and run the program.

The common* is just a template for the normal host.You can define it and rename it by you need.

The program can detect the ohtpl_area itself.

suggest:
For example you got a request and the number is 1234. You can create a file named 1234.cfg and 1234.txt. And define the template in 1234.cfg and write the hostname, ipaddress and environment in 1234.txt.
